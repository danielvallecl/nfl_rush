# NFL Rush

An App built with React to sort out data about NFL players.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Node.js, React

### Installing

To run the app follow these procedures:
